- Just like all other college students, His weekends are fun-packed. Bugs are engaging, apparently. He is looking for projects to collaborate on, and contribute to open source while polishing his own skills. For collabs, Reach out. He's one of those devs who actually reads his email: [sxryadipta@gmail.com]
